# FIX at the end:

Becky said: Completed tests on reading file with whinge, extra arguments, no argument, and misspelled arguments


- ### need to add an enum and replace error numbers in Err(1)
- ### go through *REVIEW: , TODO, FIXME* comments
- ### remove unnecessary comments

 The first section of your ReadMe.txt file should include:

    1- the number of the lab (e.g., "CSE 542 Fall 2024 Lab 1")
    2- the names and e-mail addresses of all team members
    3- an overview of how your program was designed, and
    4- insights, observations and questions you encountered while completing the assignment.

---

The second section of your ReadMe.txt file should provide detailed instructions for how to:

    1- unzip or otherwise unpack your files,
    2- build your program(s), and
    3- run your program(s) on the CEC Linux Lab machines where your lab solutions will be evaluated.

#NOTE: 

1) what the submitted program does, 
2) any places where your solution diverged from what was requested in the assignment, and 
3) the design decisions you made in developing your code. Please also ask any remaining questions you may have, in your readme file, and feedback on your impressions of the lab (what was easy, what was difficult, suggestions, etc.) is welcome.
